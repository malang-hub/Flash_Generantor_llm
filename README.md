│   └── script.js         # Client-side functionality
└── uploads/              # Temporary file storage
```

### Core Components

#### FlashcardGenerator Class
The heart of the application, responsible for:
- Loading and managing the LLM model
- Processing text into manageable chunks
- Generating question-answer pairs
- Assigning difficulty levels and topics
- Providing fallback mechanisms

#### Web Interface
- **Flask Backend**: RESTful API endpoints for flashcard generation and export

- **File Handling**: Secure file upload and processing with automatic cleanup

### AI Model Integration

The application uses Google's FLAN-T5-base model, a state-of-the-art text-to-text transformer optimized for instruction following and question-answering tasks. The model is loaded using Hugging Face's Transformers library with the following configuration:

- **Model**: google/flan-t5-base (248M parameters)
- **Task**: Text-to-text generation
- **Max Length**: 512 tokens
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity and consistency)
- **Sampling**: Enabled for diverse outputs

## API Documentation

### Endpoints

#### POST /generate_flashcards
Generates flashcards from provided content.

**Request Format**:
- Content-Type: multipart/form-data
- Parameters:
  - `content` (string): Text content for flashcard generation
  - `file` (file): Uploaded .txt or .pdf file

**Response Format**:
```json
[
